# lensMTF

quick and dirty lens testing. I've been using this chart [from Cornell](https://www.graphics.cornell.edu/~westin/misc/ISO_12233-reschart.pdf), and take the slant edge off the vertical edges near the center and the corners, in order. The slant edge method has not been aligned to any industry standard, but is only used to find relative strengths/weaknesses of lenses. I shoot raw then use ACR to convert to B&W TIF, so clearly this is measuring the whole pipeline and can't be used to extract the lens's absolute MTF.
